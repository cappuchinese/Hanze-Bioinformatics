## Glossary
+ **Curation** : Database entry checks
+ **Redundancy** : How much double code it contains (Lower is more single code)
+ **Motif** : 3D-structure that appear different, evolutionary unrelated molecules. Unrelated to sequence.

## Class assignments

## Notes
### Which techniques are used on proteins to classify them?
**Edman Degredation**: Afbreken van eerste aminozuur <br>
**SDS-PAGE**: jfhdgkjf <br>
**MALDI-TOF**: Tube filled with protein gets blasted by UV laser. Smaller bits fly out, detector meet de tijd. <br>
**PRIDE at EBI**: database for mass spectrometry

### Proteins
#### 1. Domain and motifs
According to [InterPro](https://interpro-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-are-entry-types) definitions:
+ **Domain**: Distinct functional, structural or sequence units in biological context.
+ **Family**: The common evolutionary origin by related functions, structure or sequence.
+ **Homologous Superfamily**: Common evolutionary origin by related structure, but not sequence.
+ **Repeat**: Short sequence repeated within protein.
+ **Site**: Active site, Binding site, Conserved site, PTM site (post-trans mod)

Post-translationele modificaties zijn fysische eigenschappen, ook voor klassificatie.
