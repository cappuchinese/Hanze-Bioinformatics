    "# Week 1 Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first week assignment of informatics II. By now you finished the course informatics I. This week assignment is the first step in many more steps on the ladder of becoming a professional programmer. However, the learning curve of informatics II is still steep, so keep practising programming!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week assignment you learn to apply a template based on the template proposed by Guido van Rossum (the author of Python). The template is introduced in a series of logical steps, in such a way that every step consists of three to five elements or lines of code. Three to five elements is easy to remember, which is nice, because YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS TEMPLATE BY HEART. Having a good default template is a great way to start off any program, and actually helps tackling the programming task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore you learn to transfer a problem to an algoritm and finally to a python program. This is a daily job for every programmer. It is the challenge of finding the pattern in a phenomenom and catch it into an algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you upload your code to blackboard you will be reviewed on the following aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the code according the template\n",
    "- Is your code according coding style\n",
    "- Is the output of your programm correct\n",
