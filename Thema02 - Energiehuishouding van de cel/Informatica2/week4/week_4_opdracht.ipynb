    "By now you learned about errors and how to deal with them. Errors are an integral part of programming, and finding errors and removing them, known as debugging, is an important programming skill. Errors may be frustrating, but keep in mind that an error isn't a failure. The best programmers make errors. They're just quick in getting them out again. And that is what you need to learn to become a better programmer: how to recognize errors, how to find them and how to get them out. It's much like a puzzle challenge (Tsjerk Wassenaar)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of errors: **syntax errors**, **runtime errors**, and **semantic errors**. In this week assingment you will learn to fix all three types of errors. You will fix them but also learn how to generate the errors. This will give you insight how to avoid these kind of errors in your future work. \n",

    "- Is the output of your programm correct\n",
    "- The fixsyntax and fixme program should not generate any error\n",

So print(\\_\\_builtins\\_\\_.ZeroDivisionError.\\_\\_doc\\_\\_) will print the docstring from the ZeroDivisionError from the builtins, and shows: **Second argument to a division or modulo operation was zero.** To make this part easy you can use the function below:\n"

Add one to much of those and there's a SyntaxError. The code below contains quite a number of syntax errors. The assignment is to make the code work.\n",

    "To help programmers to find errors, Python prints when and where in the code the error _became clear_. In most cases that's the same as where the error was made, but sometimes the root of the error lies somewhere in the preceding lines, especially when a parenthesis, bracket or a quote is missing. The message that Python gives is called a traceback, and it is easiest to read it from the bottom to the top. The last lines give the error and the place in the code it was encountered. Above it is the function it was called from, above that the function that was called from, etc, etc. The traceback appears when you run the code and the error pops up.
